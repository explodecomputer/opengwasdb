"""Hybrid Layout — Dense Component (reference panel) + Ragged Overflow (off-panel observed).

A Hybrid store is a thin integration layer over the existing dense and ragged
components (ADR 0026):

- The **Dense Component** is a self-contained Dense store nested at ``<store>/dense``
  whose variant axis is the completion reference panel. It is built, completed,
  top-hit-indexed, and validated by the *unchanged* dense machinery.
- The **Ragged Overflow Component** is a CSR at ``<store>/data.zarr/ragged`` holding
  each Analysis's off-panel observed associations. Its ``variant_index`` values
  reference the **shared** Store Variant Table at ``<store>/variants.tsv.gz`` (the
  union of panel ∪ off-panel-observed variants).

The two components partition each Analysis's associations disjointly: a variant is
on-panel (a Dense Component row) xor off-panel (a Ragged Overflow entry).
