"""The per-LD-block Reference Completion runner.

``run_block`` owns the whole per-block task dense and ragged completion each
used to implement separately: load the block, load its eigendecomposition
(with the standard "cannot load -- write an empty checkpoint" failure path),
derive the block's canonical ALIDs/EAF/positions, run every assigned
Analysis's imputation through ``complete_block_for_analysis`` (including the
None-ALID bookkeeping), and assemble the block's ``completion_quality`` rows
and fills. The one thing that genuinely differs by layout -- how to read an
Analysis's observed z/se at this block's positions, and which Analyses are
even assigned to this block -- is a caller-supplied ``make_reader`` seam:
dense's reader is a matrix column slice from an already-opened source zarr
group; ragged's is a per-Analysis CSR lookup built into a dict. *Where the
imputed z/se get written back* stays with each caller's own Phase 3 (dense
band-writes into a zarr matrix; ragged assembles a CSR row), since that's a
storage-shape difference this module has no need to know about.
