"""Migrate a Store Release onto the current `analyses.tsv` schema
(ADR 0030, issue #24; ADR 0034 unified schema, issue #68).

Two distinct old layouts land here, auto-detected from what the store already
has on disk:

1. Pre-issue-#22: no `analyses.tsv` at all, Analytical Metadata still lives in
   a SQLite `analyses` table (dense/hybrid stores only -- Ragged stores keep
   their own divergent `analyses` schema, out of scope per ADR 0030). Reads
   that table and its `ancestry.tsv` sidecar, when present, derives what it
   can from them, writes `analyses.tsv` + `overview.html`, drops the SQLite
   `analyses` table, and folds `ancestry_provenance.json` (when present) into
   `manifest.json`.

2. Pre-ADR-0034: `analyses.tsv` already exists (case 1 already ran, once) but
   still carries the schema `write_analyses_tsv` produced before the unified
   `Analysis` model replaced `phenotype_id`/`phenotype_label` with
   `analysis_label`/`trait_ontology_id`/`trait_ontology_label` (issue #68).
   Rewrites the file in place onto the current column set, preserving
   whatever it already recorded for completion rollups and Top-Hit Counts
   unchanged (both were already correct under the old schema, so there is
   nothing to recompute).

Top-Hit Counts (`n_hits_5e8`/`n_hits_5e6`/`n_hits_5e4`, ADR 0032) are computed
for real from the store's existing top-hit index -- that index predates
`analyses.tsv` entirely, so unlike the fields below it is genuinely recoverable,
not something this script's "don't guess" rule applies to.

Fields the old layout never recorded are written honestly, not guessed:

  * `original_sd_method` becomes `unavailable` (`OriginalSdMethod.UNAVAILABLE`)
    -- phenotype-SD provenance (issue #18) postdates every old-layout store,
    so there is no source to derive it from. `unavailable` is a real vocabulary
    member for this column, unlike the others below.
  * `sample_size_kind`/`sample_size_scope`/`sample_size`, `n_cases`/`n_controls`,
    `original_effect_scale`, and `original_sd_dispersion` stay blank. None of
    them have an `unavailable` vocabulary member (only `original_sd_method`
    and `ancestry_assignment_method` are controlled vocabularies with such a
    value), and writing an arbitrary non-vocabulary placeholder into a
    validated column would be worse than an honest blank.
  * `ancestry_assignment_method` is `af_assigned` when the sidecar recorded an
    Assigned Ancestry (every pre-#22 sidecar was written by the AF-based NNLS
    mixture fit), else blank -- not `unassigned`, which means "assignment was
    attempted and the gates rejected it," a different state from "the old
    layout recorded nothing for this Analysis."

Migration is one-way: this script has no reverse mode, and the library carries
no runtime shim for reading the old layout afterward.

Usage:
  uv run python scripts/migrate_store_to_analyses_tsv.py /path/to/store.opengwasdb
